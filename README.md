Ticker is a helper library, which allows you to write non-blocking Arduino code without calls to `delay()`.

There are two common ways, how to use the library. Let's say you want to trigger an event after five seconds:

```cpp
#include <Ticker.h>

#define TRIGGER_PERIOD 5000 // milliseconds

// Create a ticker
jsc::Ticker ticker(TRIGGER_PERIOD);

void setup() {
    ...
}

void loop() {
    if (ticker.elapsedTicks() > 0) {
        // TODO: Trigger an event

        // Reset ticker
        ticker.restart();
    }
}
```

In another example, we want to trigger an event after five seconds, as in first case. However, Ticker will increment its counter after 10 milliseconds, which is a default value. To determine, whether a time period has elapsed, you need to divide overall time period by partial time periods. This value represents expected counter value. Let's see an example:

```cpp
#include <Ticker.h>

// Create a ticker with a tick period of 10 ms
jsc::Ticker ticker();

void setup() {
    ...
}

void loop() {
	// Trigger an event after five seconds
    if (ticker.elapsedTicks() > (5000 / 10)) {
        // TODO: Trigger an event

        // Reset ticker
        ticker.restart();
    }
}
```
