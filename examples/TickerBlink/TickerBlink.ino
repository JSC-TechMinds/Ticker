/**
 * @brief Blink
 *
 * Turns on LED for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
 * 
 * This sketch was inspired by the Arduino Blink Sketch. The main difference is
 * that we don't use blocking calls to <code>delay()</code>. Instead, we
 * create a Timer instance, which tracks whether a time period has elapsed.
 * 
 * While Arduino is waiting, it can perform other tasks.
